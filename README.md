 built a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page. The following outlines what you need to do.

## Step 1 - Scraping

Complete your initial scraping using Jupyter Notebook, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Requests/Splinter.

* Created a Jupyter Notebook file called `mission_to_mars.ipynb` and used this to complete all of your scraping and analysis tasks. The following outlines what you need to scrape.

### NASA Mars News

* Scrape the [NASA Mars News Site](https://mars.nasa.gov/news/) and collect the latest News Title and Paragraph Text. Assign the text to variables that you can reference later.

### JPL Mars Space Images - Featured Image

* Visited the url for JPL Featured Space Image [here](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/?search=&category=Mars).

* Used splinter to navigate the site and find the image url for the current Featured Mars Image and assign the url string to a variable called `featured_image_url`.

### Mars Weather

* Visited the Mars Weather twitter account [here](https://twitter.com/marswxreport?lang=en) and scraped the latest Mars weather tweet from the page. Save the tweet text for the weather report as a variable called `mars_weather`.


### Mars Facts

* Visited the Mars Facts webpage [here](http://space-facts.com/mars/) and used Pandas to scrape the table containing facts about the planet including Diameter, Mass, etc.

* Used Pandas to convert the data to a HTML table string.

### Mars Hemispheres

* Visited the USGS Astrogeology site [here](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars) to obtain high resolution images for each of Mar's hemispheres.
